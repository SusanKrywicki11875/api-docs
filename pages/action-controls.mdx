# Action Controls

<span className="lead">
  Add visual control over how your components behave in
  Framer X.
</span>

<div>

Action Controls allow you to customize and define new
events in Framer X, and then attach them visually to your
components on the canvas. After selecting something from
the canvas, you'll see available actions controls on the
right, under the "Events‚Äù panel.

</div>

<div>

If you have a Frame selected, you'll find a list of
default events, such as `onTap`, `onWheel`,
`onMouseEnter`, and more.

After selecting an event, you'll be able to choose an action. You can chain as many events and actions together as you want.

</div>

## Custom Events

If you have any custom actions defined, you'll also find them in this menu. Keep on reading to learn how to create and add custom actions.

```jsx
addPropertyControls(MyComponent, {
  myCustomEvent: { type: ControlType.EventHandler },
})
```

If you need to add an action control to a custom event, such as an `onModalClose` or `onIconTap`, you can register these events in the Framer UI by adding these events through Property Controls.

To add a custom event to the Framer UI, use the `addPropertyControls` function, and give your event a `type` of `ControlType.EventHandler`.

## Custom Actions

By default, you have the option to choose between a set of built in actions:

```jsx
export function customAction(): ActionHandler {
  return () => {
    console.log("I'm a custom action")
  }
}
```

- Open URL
- Log
- Navigate

Framer also provides an API to create and attach your own custom Actions.

Using the `ActionHandler` type on a function, you'll then see the option to attach this action in the Event UI panel on the left (after selecting an event).

## Action Controls

Not only can we create custom actions, but we can also make them more dynamic by giving our user control over what the events might actually do using the `addActionControls` function.

```jsx
import {
  addActionControls,
  ControlType,
  ActionHandler,
} from "framer"
```

To give your custom action Action Controls, import both the `addActionControls` function and the `ControlType` type from the `framer` library.

```jsx
addActionControls(customAction, "Title", {
  text: {
    type: ControlType.String,
  },
})
```

The Control Types you can add follow the same controls you can add through Property Controls. Read more about Property Controls to see what you can add to Action Controls.

```jsx
export function customAction({ text }): ActionHandler {
  return () => {
    console.log(text)
  }
}
```

In the example above, we've added a String Control Type to our `customAction` we created earlier. We can now use this as a `prop` within our Action Control.
