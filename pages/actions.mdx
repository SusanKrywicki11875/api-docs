# Actions

<span className="lead">
  Visually define the way your components respond to events
  in Framer.
</span>

<div>

Actions in Framer allow you to define how your components respond to events. When a user selects an element on the canvas, any available events will appear on the right, under the Prototyping panel.

From here, they'll be able to choose one or more actions, such as navigating or opening a URL. By default, you have the option to choose between a set of built in actions:

- Open URL
- Log
- Navigate

Apart from the default actions, custom actions can also be added to accomodate for different setups.

</div>

## Custom Events

Custom events can be added to code components through [Property Controls](https://www.framer.com/api/property-controls/) in Framer. Added events will appear in the Prototyping panel when selected.

```jsx
addPropertyControls(MyComponent, {
  myCustomEvent: { type: ControlType.EventHandler },
})
```

To add a custom event to the Framer UI, use the `addPropertyControls` function, and give your event a `type` of `ControlType.EventHandler`.

---

## Custom Actions

Framer also provides an API to create and attach your own custom Actions.

```jsx
export function customAction(): ActionHandler {
  return () => {
    console.log("I'm a custom action")
  }
}
```

When using the `ActionHandler` type on a function, you'll see the option to attach this action in the Events UI panel on the right (after selecting an event).

---

## Action Controls

Not only can you create custom actions, but you can make them more dynamic by giving your user control over what the events might actually do by using the `addActionControls` function.

```jsx
import {
  addActionControls,
  ControlType,
  ActionHandler,
} from "framer"
```

To give your custom action Action Controls, import both the `addActionControls` function and the `ControlType` type from the `framer` library.

```jsx
addActionControls(customAction, "Title", {
  text: {
    type: ControlType.String,
  },
})
```

The Control Types you can add follow the same controls you can add through Property Controls. [Read more](https://www.framer.com/api/property-controls/#adding-controls) about Property Controls to see what type of controls you can add to actions.

```jsx
export function customAction({ text }): ActionHandler {
  return () => {
    console.log(text)
  }
}
```

In the example above, we've added a String Control Type to our `customAction` we created earlier. We can now use this through `props` within our Action Control.
