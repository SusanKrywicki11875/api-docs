# Navigation

<span className="lead">
  Navigation in Framer is built on top of the Framer API.
  Learn how to customize and create flows easily.
</span>

Expressing flows is an important part of the prototyping process, and easy to set up in Framer. Continue reading to learn how to set up your own flows, or create something new for your project.

---

## Navigate

The Navigate [action](/api/actions) in Framer is one of the default actions you can use. Navigate provides a number of customizable options, such as Target, Transition, and more.

You'll see this as an option under the Prototyping panel after selecting an event. If you use the Prototype Connector or the hotkey "L", the Navigate action will be attached to the `onTap` event by default.

---

## useNavigation

Similarly to Action Controls, navigation is also handled through code. The useNavigation hook can be called from within a function component, a code override, or a custom action.

```jsx highlight=2,5
export function CustomAction(): ActionHandler {
  const navigation = useNavigation()

  return () => {
    navigation.goBack()
  }
}
```

---

### Transitions

All of the transitions in the Framer UI are also available from code. All transitions require a `ComponentInstance` as the first argument other than the `goBack()` transition.

Certain transitions can also accept more arguments to customize it's behavior. If you're using the `useNavigation` hook with [custom actions](/api/actions/#custom-actions), it might be helpful to pass a `ComponentInstance` to the custom action through `ActionControls`.

---

### Go Back

`goBack()` shows the previous screen, using the original transition that was used to navigate to the current screen.

```jsx
navigation.goBack()
```

---

### Instant

`instant()` shows the next screen instantly.

```jsx
navigation.instant(<Component />)
```

---

### Fade

`fade()` brings the user to the next screen by fading out the current screen and fading in the next.

```jsx
navigation.fade(<Component />)
```

---

### Push

<div>

`push()` brings the user to the next screen by pushing the current screen out of view with the next.

You can customize which way the screen pushes through the `appearFrom` property. Set to `right` by default.

</div>

```jsx
navigation.push(<Component />)
navigation.push(<Component />, { appearFrom: "top" }) // optional
```

---

### Modal

`modal()` fades in the next screen on top of the current screen in the center.

You can customize the backdrop color through the `backdropColor` property. Set to `rgba(4,4,15,0.4)` by default.

```jsx
navigation.modal(<Component />)
navigation.modal(<Component />, {
  backdropColor: "rgba(4,4,15,0.4)",
}) // optional
```

---

### Overlay

`overlay()` pushes the next screen on top of the current screen.

You can customize which way the screen pushes through the `appearFrom` property, and the backdrop color through the `backdropColor` property. Set to `right` and `rgba(4,4,15,0.4)` by default.

```jsx
navigation.overlay(<Component />)
navigation.overlay(<Component />, {
  appearFrom: "left",
  backdropColor: "rgba(4,4,15,0.4)",
}) // optional
```

---

### Flip

`flip()` shows the next screen by flipping the current screen 180 degrees.

You can customize which way the screen flips through the `appearFrom` property. Set to `right` by default.

```jsx
navigation.flip(<Component />)
navigation.flip(<Component />, { appearFrom: "right" }) // optional
```

---

## Custom Transitions

Just a little bit about custom transitions.

### Custom Transition

<div>

`customTransition()` allows you to design and customize the flows your users will experience through your prototypes.

All built-in transitions are defined using the same API as custom transitions. The definition contains eight properties which are all optional.

</div>

```jsx
navigation.customTransition(
  <Component />,
  userTransitionDefinition
)
```

---

### position:

placeholder text

```jsx
  // Defines the position and size of the incoming screen wrapper. Defaults to top, right, bottom, and left of 0.
  position?: NavigationTransitionPosition
```

---

### animation:

placeholder text

```jsx
  // The animation defaults.
  animation?: Transition
```

---

### overCurrentContext:

placeholder text

```jsx
  // Defines whether the incoming screen should render over the current context, like an overlay or modal. Defaults to false.
  overCurrentContext?: boolean
```

---

### backdropColor:

placeholder text

```jsx
  // Defines the backdrop color when the incoming screen is rendered over the current context. Defaults to the iOS dim color.
  backdropColor?: string
```

---

### goBackOnTapOutside:

placeholder text

```jsx
  // Defines whether a tap in the background should dismiss the screen presented over the current context. Defaults to true.
  goBackOnTapOutside?: boolean
```

---

### backfaceVisible:

placeholder text

```jsx
  // Defines whether the backface of the incoming and outgoing screens should be visible, necessary for certain 3D transitions. Defaults to true.
  backfaceVisible?: boolean
```

---

### enter:

placeholder text

```jsx
  // Defines the begin state of the incoming screen wrapper.
  enter?: Partial<FrameProps>
```

---

### exit:

placeholder text

```jsx
  // Defines the end state of the outgoing screen wrapper.
  exit?: Partial<FrameProps>
```

---

`enter` and `exit` are used by the Navigation component to apply a transform and opacity to the incoming and outgoing screens. The enter props are applied to the incoming screen when presented. At the end of the transition animation all enter props will be normalized. This means that an x of 200 will end at 0. And an opacity of 0, will animate to 1. The exit props are applied to the outgoing screen.

By default incoming screens will take the full width and height. Using the position prop you can change this. The position allows for setting `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, and `center` of the incoming screen.

When creating an overlay or modal transition, you have to set `overCurrentContext` to `true`. This means that the outgoing screen will be visible at the end of the transition. The backdrop color can be changed to dim the background.
