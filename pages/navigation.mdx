# Navigation

<span className="lead">
  Navigation in Framer is built on top of the Framer API.
  Learn how to customize and create flows easily.
</span>

Expressing flows is an important part of the prototyping process, and easy to set up in Framer. Continue reading to learn how to set up your own flows, or create something new for your project.

---

## Navigate

The Navigate [action](/api/actions) in Framer is one of the default actions you can use. Navigate provides a number of customizable options, such as Target, Transition, and more.

You'll see this as an option under the Prototyping panel after selecting an event. If you use the Prototype Connector or the hotkey "L", the Navigate action will be attached to the `onTap` event by default.

---

## useNavigation

Similarly to Action Controls, navigation is also handled through code. The useNavigation hook can be called from within a function component, a code override, or a custom action.

```jsx highlight=2,5
export function CustomAction(): ActionHandler {
  const navigation = useNavigation()

  return () => {
    navigation.goBack()
  }
}
```

---

### Transitions

All of the transitions in the Framer UI are also available from code. All transitions require a `ComponentInstance` as the first argument other than the `goBack()` transition.

Certain transitions can also accept more arguments to customize it's behavior. If you're using the `useNavigation` hook with [custom actions](/api/actions/#custom-actions), it might be helpful to pass a `ComponentInstance` to the custom action through `ActionControls`.

---

### Go Back

`goBack()` shows the previous screen, using the original transition that was used to navigate to the current screen.

```jsx
navigation.goBack()
```

---

### Instant

`instant()` shows the next screen instantly.

```jsx
navigation.instant(<Component />)
```

---

### Fade

`fade()` brings the user to the next screen by fading out the current screen and fading in the next.

```jsx
navigation.fade(<Component />)
```

---

### Push

<div>

`push()` brings the user to the next screen by pushing the current screen out of view with the next.

You can customize which way the screen pushes through the `appearFrom` property. Set to `right` by default.

</div>

```jsx
navigation.push(<Component />)
navigation.push(<Component />, { appearFrom: "top" }) // optional
```

---

### Modal

`modal()` fades in the next screen on top of the current screen in the center.

You can customize the backdrop color through the `backdropColor` property. Set to `rgba(4,4,15,0.4)` by default.

```jsx
navigation.modal(<Component />)
navigation.modal(<Component />, {
  backdropColor: "rgba(4,4,15,0.4)",
}) // optional
```

---

### Overlay

`overlay()` pushes the next screen on top of the current screen.

You can customize which way the screen pushes through the `appearFrom` property, and the backdrop color through the `backdropColor` property. Set to `right` and `rgba(4,4,15,0.4)` by default.

```jsx
navigation.overlay(<Component />)
navigation.overlay(<Component />, {
  appearFrom: "left",
  backdropColor: "rgba(4,4,15,0.4)",
}) // optional
```

---

### Flip

`flip()` shows the next screen by flipping the current screen 180 degrees.

You can customize which way the screen flips through the `appearFrom` property. Set to `right` by default.

```jsx
navigation.flip(<Component />)
navigation.flip(<Component />, { appearFrom: "right" }) // optional
```

---

## Custom Transitions

Not only can you use the built in default transitions, but you have the ability to create your own.

### Custom Transition

<div>

`customTransition()` allows you to design and customize the flows your users will experience through your prototypes.

All built-in transitions are defined using the same API as custom transitions. The definition contains eight properties which are all optional.

</div>

```jsx
navigation.customTransition(
  <Component />,
  userTransitionDefinition
)
```

---

<h3>position: <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>NavigationTransitionPosition</span></h3>

Defines the position and size of the incoming screen wrapper. Defaults to `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` of `0`.

```jsx highlight=4,5,6,8,10,11
export function CustomAction(): ActionHandler {
  const navigation = useNavigation()

  const CustomTransition: NavigationTransition = {
    position: { top: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0, left: 0 },
  }
  return () => {
    navigation.customTransition(
      <Component />
      CustomTransition
    )
  }
}
```

---

<h3>animation: <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>Transition</span></h3>

[Animation](/api/animation/) options that set the transition properties for the animation.

```jsx highlight=4,5,6,7,8,9,12,14,15
export function CustomAction(): ActionHandler {
  const navigation = useNavigation()

  const CustomTransition: NavigationTransition = {
    animation: {
        type: "spring"
        stiffness: 300,
        damping: 100,
    }
  }
  return () => {
    navigation.customTransition(
      <Component />
      CustomTransition
    )
  }
}
```

---

<h3>overCurrentContext: <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>boolean</span></h3>

Defines whether the incoming screen should render over the current context, like an overlay or modal. Defaults to `false`.

```jsx highlight=4,5,6,8,10,11
export function CustomAction(): ActionHandler {
  const navigation = useNavigation()

  const CustomTransition: NavigationTransition = {
    overCurrentContext: true,
  }
  return () => {
    navigation.customTransition(
      <Component />
      CustomTransition
    )
  }
}
```

---

<h3>backdropColor: <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>string</span></h3>

Defines the backdrop color when the incoming screen is rendered over the current context. Defaults to `rgba(4,4,15,0.4)`.

```jsx highlight=4,5,6,8,10,11
export function CustomAction(): ActionHandler {
  const navigation = useNavigation()

  const CustomTransition: NavigationTransition = {
    backdropColor: "rgba(4,4,15,0.4)",
  }
  return () => {
    navigation.customTransition(
      <Component />
      CustomTransition
    )
  }
}
```

---

<h3>goBackOnTapOutside: <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>boolean</span></h3>

Defines whether a tap in the background should dismiss the screen presented over the current context. Defaults to `true`.

```jsx highlight=4,5,6,8,10,11
export function CustomAction(): ActionHandler {
  const navigation = useNavigation()

  const CustomTransition: NavigationTransition = {
    goBackOnTapOutside: true,
  }
  return () => {
    navigation.customTransition(
      <Component />
      CustomTransition
    )
  }
}
```

---

<h3>backfaceVisible: <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>boolean</span></h3>

Defines whether the backface of the incoming and outgoing screens should be visible, necessary for certain 3D transitions. Defaults to `true`.

```jsx highlight=4,5,6,8,10,11
export function CustomAction(): ActionHandler {
  const navigation = useNavigation()

  const CustomTransition: NavigationTransition = {
    backfaceVisible: true,
  }
  return () => {
    navigation.customTransition(
      <Component />
      CustomTransition
    )
  }
}

<h3>enter: <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>Partial&lt;FrameProps&gt;</span></h3>

Defines the begin state of the incoming screen wrapper.

```jsx highlight=4,5,6,8,10,11

  const navigation = useNavigation()

  const CustomTransition: NavigationTransition = {
    enter: { y: "100%" },
  }
  return () => {
    navigation.customTransition(
      <Component />
      CustomTransition
    )
  }
}
```

```jsx highlight=4,5,6,8,10,11
export function CustomAction(): ActionHandler {
  const navigation = useNavigation()

  const CustomTransition: NavigationTransition = {
    exit: { y: "100%" },
  }
  return () => {
    navigation.customTransition(
      <Component />
      CustomTransition
    )
